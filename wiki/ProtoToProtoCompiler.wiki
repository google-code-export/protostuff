#summary ProtoToProto Compiler Description

= Extending proto messages = 

*proto_extender* compiler is designed to make one possible to extend his proto messages
with another ones. 

It works like a preprocessor for your proto files and can help you to handle some inheritance
issues.

= Features =

 * extend one message with fields from another 
 * annotations on the fields will be included too
 * {{{[defaults]}}} on the fields will no be inculded (this is not implemented yet)
 * annotations on the extender will to be included
 * no transitive extend resolution (this is not implemented yet)

= Usage =

There are 2 kinds of ways to ask it to extend for you some message:

 * include {{{ option extends = ExtenderMessageName; }}} at the first line after definition
of extendable message.
 * apply an attribute on extendable message {{{ @Extend(by = ExtenderMessageName) }}}

_Warning. Transitive resolution of extendables is not support yet. So if you want A to be extended
by B that should be extended by C, this is not possible right now._

= Sample = 

{{{
    @Extend(by = ItemBase)
    message Item {
        // or instead of @, this can be used: option extends = ItemBase;

        required int32 xxx = 10;
        optional string yyy = 11;
    }

    message ItemBase {
        required int32 id = 1;
        @Test(v = 1, a = "bbb")
        optional string name = 2;
    }
}}}

the compilation result will be looked like:

{{{
    // @Extend(by = ItemBase)
    message Item {
        // Extended by ItemBase at ....
        required int32 id = 1;
        @Test(v = 1, a = "bbb")
        optional string name = 2;

        required int32 xxx = 10;
        optional string yyy = 11;
    }

    message ItemBase {
        required int32 id = 1;
        @Test(v = 1, a = "bbb")
        optional string name = 2;
    }   
}}}

as you can see, fields id's in extendable message should not intersect with 
fields id's in extender message.

= Sample 2 = 

{{{    
    message Item {
        required int32 id = 1;
        optional string name = 2;
    }

    @Extend(by = Item)
    message Weapon {        
    }

    @Extend(by = Item)
    message Drug {        
    }

    @Extend(by = Item)
    message Pet {        
    }
}}}
